# Songtiment

## Description

I have developed an application called Songtiment which aims to assist parents and guardians in determining whether a song is appropriate for their children to listen to. Unlike other applications that rely on language-based filters, Songtiment uses sentiment analysis to assess the overall tone and emotion of a song. Our goal is to provide a more nuanced approach to evaluating music and help users make informed decisions about what their kids listen to.

In today's world, where music is easily accessible through various platforms, it can be difficult for parents and guardians to keep track of what their children are listening to. While some songs may not contain explicit lyrics or language, they can still have negative or inappropriate themes that may not be suitable for young listeners. This is where Songtiment comes in, providing a solution to this issue by analyzing a song's sentiment and providing an overall rating of its appropriateness.
